A second read me for more info.

Gloom is a smallish mod for Skyrim.
It renders cells and models and npcs,
but doesn't do anything beside that.

Gloom started as Messiah, which was continued by Dark, then Gloom.

I tried to maybe build a narrative, or a style,
but always wound up "just writing the engine." 

I'm not good at quests, story, and my
imagination was just drifting.

But if your code is good, you don't need
good ideas or a steadfast memory. You
could shrink or grow anything spontaneously.
