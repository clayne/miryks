A second read me for more info.

Gloom is a smallish mod for Skyrim.
It renders cells and models and npcs,
but doesn't do anything beside that. It's more
sdk than mod?

Gloom started as Messiah, which was continued by Dark, then Gloom.

I tried to maybe build a narrative, or a style,
but always wound up "just writing the engine." 

I'm not good at quests, story, and such,
apparently, my imagination just drifts. Idk.
