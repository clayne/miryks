# Gloom

special-edition is the new default branch, legendary edition not good enough

ironically were still stuck in 32 bit for now

feel free to use bits of my code or entire files, /lib is quite nice and /src/skyrim too

in cmd:  
premake5 vs2019

in VsDevCmd.bat then cd to /gloom:  
msbuild /property:Configuration=Release  
optionally you can add -target:Clean / Rebuild
